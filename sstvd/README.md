# SSTVD Example

_Example of using SSTVD in `elastix`_

## Image data

* 3D thoracic CT (inhale/exhale phases from 4DCT)
* Voxel size 1 x 1 x 3 mm
* Dimension 512 x 512 x 114

The sample CT dataset is available for download (https://github.com/guycl/elastix_examples/tree/master/sstvd).

## Application

Registration of intra-patient thoracic CT scans in the presence of respiratory motion causing compression/expansion of lung parenchyma

## Registration settings

`elastix` version: 4.8

The SumSquaredTissueVolumeDifference metric was implemented in `elastix` during the course of this work.

Command line call: elastix -p params_sstvd.txt -f scan_inhale.mhd -m scan_exhale.mhd -out .
